Task completed. My takeaways:
-> Practice with data structures (2d arrays, Stack) <br>
-> More practice with MVC pattern <br>
-> Practical use of Functional interface and method referencing <br>
-> Getting familiar with reading KeyEvents and connecting appropriate model methods to these <br>
-> A lot of practice with commenting code - there were several complex methods that would be difficult to understand for someone not familiar with the code
